Distributions via maximum entropy methods:

http://www.mtm.ufsc.br/~taneja/book/node14.html

If you care about:

* lower and upper bound: uniform on reals

* mean and variance: gaussian

* mean and L1 norm: Laplace

* mean and log L2 norm: t-distribution/Cauchy

* mean and 0 bound on naturals: exponential

* mean and mean log: gamma

* log X and log (1 - X): beta

* mean log X and L2 of log x: log-normal

* mean log X and a given starting point: Pareto
